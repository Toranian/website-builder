# What is this project about?
I've noticed that I keep writing out the same basic website structure over and over again, so naturally, I have to spend hundreds of hours building a tool to automate the process.

## The main idea
After running the `main.py` file, the user will specify the parameters for the website, and the tool will generate the basic template.

# Basic Roadmap / Ideas for the future
- The title of the website
- Basic template choosing
- Simple Firebase integration
- Custom CSS styling 
- Ability to choose components such as users, posts, blog, landingpage, etc.
